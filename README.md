A set of AI tools to generate and convert thematic content

## Overview

We're deep into the era of bigdata being processed and reprocessed over and over to be fed into processing infrastructure again. This happens so often that data that the infrastructure sees was probably already processed and mutated several timesâ€”starting from autocorrection and filters of social media all the way to social bots dumping copies of copies back into the internet and LLMs learning from the content that was already generated by its predecessors.

This repository contains various AI scripts to process automatically generated information into the formats that can then be more easily fed back into AI for bigdata processing and such.
